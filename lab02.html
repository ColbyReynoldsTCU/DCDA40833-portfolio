            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Artificial intelligence tools are becoming common in academic, professional, and everyday work. In data-focused fields such as Data Analysis (DCDA), these tools can assist with writing, explanation, and early-stage analysis. At the same time, their growing use raises important questions about accuracy, reliability, and appropriate use. This lab evaluates two popular text-based AI tools, ChatGPT and Google Gemini, using a structured framework that examines their capabilities, limitations, ethical considerations, and role in analytical work. This analysis argues that while both tools can meaningfully support learning and productivity, they must be used critically and cannot replace human judgment or verification.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Tool 1: ChatGPT</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>ChatGPT performed well in academic writing and conceptual explanation tasks. When prompted to generate an introduction for a DCDA lab report, it produced a clear, organized response that stayed within the required word count and matched the requested tone. The writing included a clear thesis and flowed logically, making it useful for drafting or refining academic content.</p>

            <p>ChatGPT also explained the concept of a correlation matrix accurately and in plain language. It clearly defined correlation values and used a familiar real-world example to demonstrate how correlation can be misleading. This made the explanation accessible without oversimplifying the concept.</p>
                
            <p>However, limitations appeared when ChatGPT was asked to provide recent U.S. AI policy changes with citations. While the response was detailed and confident, some claims were difficult to verify. This highlights a key weakness: the tool can present uncertain or speculative information with a high level of confidence..</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>ChatGPT is best used as a drafting assistant, brainstorming partner, or conceptual explainer. It fits well into academic workflows for early-stage writing and learning. It should not be relied upon as a primary source for factual claims or policy analysis without independent verification.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>ChatGPT is trained on a mixture of licensed data, publicly available content, and human-created text. Because the training data is not fully transparent, bias and gaps in knowledge are possible. Its authoritative tone increases the risk of misinformation if users do not critically evaluate outputs. Ethical use requires disclosure, careful review, and fact-checking.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Tool 2: Gemini</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Gemini demonstrated strong performance in producing formal, research-oriented writing. Its lab introduction emphasized evaluation methods, data validity, and analytical skills. Compared to ChatGPT, Gemini’s tone was more technical and cautious, which may be beneficial in academic contexts.</p>

            <p>Gemini also provided a clear and structured explanation of correlation matrices, using bullet points and concise definitions. It followed prompt constraints closely and avoided unnecessary detail. One limitation was that its tone occasionally assumed prior technical knowledge, which could reduce accessibility for some audiences.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Gemini is well-suited for formal academic writing, structured explanations, and research-focused tasks. It may be less effective for creative writing or conversational explanations.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Like ChatGPT, Gemini raises concerns about training data transparency and potential bias. Although it appears more cautious in speculative areas, it still requires user oversight. Users must ensure originality, verify information, and disclose AI assistance appropriately.</p>

            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>AI tools can enhance DCDA workflows by reducing repetitive work and supporting exploration, but they do not replace critical thinking or ethical judgment. Skills such as data interpretation, contextual reasoning, and decision-making remain uniquely human. When evaluating future AI tools, important questions include how the tool handles uncertainty, what data it is trained on, and how easily its outputs can be verified. Asking these questions helps ensure responsible and effective use as AI tools continue to evolve.</p>
