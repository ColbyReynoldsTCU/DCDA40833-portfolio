            <p>
                This dashboard explores NFL passing data from <strong>2001–2023</strong>. It includes a line chart to show league-wide trends,
                a scatterplot-style view to compare volume vs. production, and a heatmap to highlight breaks in patterns by team and year.

            <h2>Reflection & Analysis</h2>

            <h3>1. Data Preparation</h3>
            <p>
                For this project I used an NFL passing dataset covering seasons from 2001 through 2023. Before building any visuals in Tableau Public,
                I had to make sure the file would upload cleanly and that Tableau interpreted the data types correctly. One issue was that the dataset
                included an extra index column (often labeled something like <em>“Unnamed: 0”</em>). Tableau treats this as a usable field, but it does not
                represent football data, so I removed it (or hid it) to avoid accidentally using it in charts. I also reviewed column names and noticed
                several fields used symbols (for example <em>Cmp%</em>, <em>TD%</em>, and <em>Int%</em>) and a dash-based label (<em>Yds-s</em>). Tableau can
                still read these, but renaming them to cleaner labels made the workflow smoother and reduced confusion when creating calculations or
                editing tooltips.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest preparation step was handling outliers caused by the structure of the dataset. Because the file includes every player who
                attempted a pass, not just quarterbacks, there are “trick play” rows where a non-QB has one attempt and a touchdown, creating extreme
                efficiency values like unusually high ANY/A or TD%. These can distort patterns if the goal is to analyze typical passing trends. To solve
                this, I created a filter for “primary passers” by setting a minimum Attempts threshold (for example, Att ≥ 200). This ensured the visuals
                focused on real QB seasons rather than one-off gadget plays. I also sanity-checked years and noticed that some records can appear with
                suspicious season values; this reinforced why it’s important to validate data during exploratory analysis instead of trusting every row as
                correct.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Design Choices</h3>
            <p>
                My dashboard is designed to reveal both long-term patterns and breaks in patterns. I used <strong>Year</strong> as the main time dimension
                and <strong>Player</strong> and <strong>Tm (team)</strong> as key categorical dimensions. For measures, I chose a mix of volume and efficiency
                metrics: passing yards (Yds) and attempts (Att) represent workload and offensive emphasis, while passer rating (Rate) and adjusted net yards
                per attempt (ANY/A) capture efficiency and overall performance. These are useful because volume alone can be misleading; a passer can throw a
                lot without being efficient, and vice versa.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created three complementary visuals. First, a line chart summarizes how passing has changed over time across the league. Second, a
                scatterplot-style view compares volume and outcomes (for example Att vs Yds or TD), which makes it easy to identify exceptional seasons
                relative to the norm. Third, a heatmap with Team on one axis and Year on the other highlights where certain teams have unusually strong or
                weak passing efficiency in particular eras. Together, these views support exploration: a viewer can see the big picture, then drill down to
                individual teams and seasons using filters.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Expected Patterns</h3>
            <p>
                Based on general NFL knowledge, I expected passing to increase over time as the league moved toward a more pass-heavy style of play. Changes
                in offensive strategy, rule emphasis that protects quarterbacks and receivers, and the growth of spread/shotgun concepts all suggest that both
                passing volume and efficiency should rise from the early 2000s into the 2010s and 2020s. The line chart largely confirmed this expectation.
                When focusing on primary passers (Att ≥ 200), later seasons show a higher baseline for production and/or efficiency than the early years.
                This indicates that “typical” QB seasons have become more productive over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also expected a positive relationship between passing attempts and passing yards or touchdowns. In the scatterplot view, most seasons follow
                that relationship: higher attempts generally correspond to higher yards and more scoring, which supports the idea that teams that throw more
                tend to generate more passing output. This matched my expectations and helped validate that the dataset captures realistic league behavior.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Surprises/Outliers</h3>
            <p>
                The most interesting insights came from outliers and breaks in the pattern. Some seasons stand far above the main cluster in the scatterplot,
                representing historically elite QB years. These seasons are surprising because they are not just slightly better than the norm—they are
                statistically separated from typical performance. In addition to genuine football outliers, there were also “data outliers” that appeared
                suspicious. For example, a player-season record showing a modern quarterback in an impossible year is a sign of a scraping or labeling error.
                This kind of anomaly is easy to miss without visualization, but it becomes obvious when a point appears in the wrong time period or doesn’t
                fit any realistic trend. The heatmap also revealed abrupt changes for certain teams, where efficiency spikes or drops sharply from one year to
                the next, suggesting transitions like coaching changes, quarterback injuries, roster turnover, or scheme shifts.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Questions for Further Investigation</h3>
            <p>
                These outliers raise questions that could guide deeper analysis. For historically elite seasons, what explains the separation from the rest of
                the league—scheme, supporting cast, strength of schedule, or rule environment? Do these seasons remain outliers if we control for pace or game
                script? For team-level spikes and drops in the heatmap, what changed from one year to the next? Was there a new coach or coordinator, a
                quarterback change, or a major injury? Finally, for suspicious data records, what step in the data pipeline introduced the error, and how
                should those rows be cleaned or excluded? Answering these questions would require additional data sources (injury reports, coaching history,
                schedule difficulty, or play-by-play data), but the Tableau visuals help pinpoint exactly where to investigate.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Tool Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                Tableau Public is a strong tool for exploratory visualization because it makes iteration fast. I could quickly swap measures, adjust chart
                types, apply filters, and build a dashboard without writing code. Its biggest advantage is interactivity: viewers can filter by team, year, or
                player and immediately see how the story changes. Tableau also makes it easy to combine multiple views into a single, shareable dashboard for
                a portfolio.
            </p>
            <p>
                That said, Tableau is not as strong as Python or R for heavy data cleaning, advanced statistical modeling, or fully reproducible analysis.
                Most of the friction I encountered involved ensuring fields imported correctly and applying filters to prevent misleading small-sample
                outliers. In a coding environment, I could more easily validate records (for example, detecting impossible player-year combinations) and track
                every transformation step. Even with those limitations, Tableau Public is excellent for quickly identifying patterns and breaks in patterns and
                communicating them clearly to a non-technical audience.
